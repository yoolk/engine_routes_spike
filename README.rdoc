== Getting Started

This spike simulates the idea that an InstantWebsite domain will route and be handled by the InstantWebsite Engine.

1. Clone the repo, running bundle and migrating the database.
2. Add the seed data `rake db:seed`
3. Uncomment the InstantWebsite mount line in routes.rb
4. Start the application. Navigate to the home page http://localhost:3000. This should load the main apps home page.
5. Navigate to the products page: http://localhost:3000/products
6. Now terminate the application and update one of the InstantWebsite Domains to be 'localhost' `InstantWebsite::Domain.last.update_attributes(name: "localhost")`
7. Restart the application and now http://localhost:3000 will go to the InstantWebsite home page and http://localhost:3000/products will go to the InstantWebsite Products page
